# Portfolio-Projects

Whoever is reading or investigating my source code, please be understandable. I am just an uncommercial junior who really wants to be a Software Developer in the future and fingers cross will start dreamed job soon ;). These three projects took me more than a year and I have started thanks to Digital Native BootCamp:

- Level 1 - HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
- Level 2 - Migration into TypeScript,
- Level 3 - Redeveloping TypeScript into Angular (second migration)

That was such a great time to spend on these projects. Irreplaceable knowledge ;)
